4dragon
=======

Turn any thread on __/q/__ (moot disabled ids on /b/ lately, so we just have to wing it) into a dragon slaying match - like [entomb/dragonchan](https://github.com/entomb/dragonchan).

This script aims to produce a similar experience to dragonchan, but in a more condensed Pythonic way.  
Classes (Heroes, in 4dragon) are chosen via the same post id checks, so if you've played dragonchan you've played 4dragon.  
Rather than providing a website front end out of the box, this is more meant to be a modular way allowing others to write front ends, should they feel like it.
